## BBC News Classification

### Introduction

BBC News Text Classification refers to the process of categorizing news articles published by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) into different predefined categories or topics. This classification task is essential for organizing and managing large volumes of news content, enabling efficient retrieval and recommendation systems, and providing users with a better browsing experience.

Text classification is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) that involves training machine learning models to automatically assign predefined labels or categories to text documents based on their content. In the case of BBC News, the goal is to classify articles into various topics such as politics, sports, entertainment, technology, health, and more.

### Objectives 

The project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify news articles from the BBC into different categories such as sports, politics, entertainment, technology, and more.

### About the Dataset

The BBC [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/view?usp=sharing) contains 2225 examples of news articles with their respective labels.

Specifically, the project will involve:

1. Data Collection: Gathering comprehensive dataset of news articles from the BBC across various categories. 

2. Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data to remove noise, irrelevant information, and standardize the text format. 

3. Feature Extraction: Extracting meaningful features from the preprocessed text data that can effectively represent the content of each news article. 

4. Model Selection: Exploring and evaluating different machine learning algorithms suitable for text classification tasks. 

5. Model Training and Evaluation: Training the selected machine learning model using the preprocessed data and evaluating its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
